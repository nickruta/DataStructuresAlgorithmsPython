class HashTable:
    """One of the great benefits of a dictionary is the fact that given a key,
    we can look up the as- sociated data value very quickly. In order to
    provide this fast look up capability, we need an implementation that
    supports an efficient search. We could use a list with sequential or binary
    search but it would be even better to use a hash table as described below
    since looking up an item in a hash table can approach ùëÇ(1) performance.


    Big-O Complexity:
        We stated earlier that in the best case hashing would provide a ùëÇ(1),
        constant time search technique. However, due to collisions, the number
        of comparisons is typically not so simple. Even though a complete
        analysis of hashing is beyond the scope of this text, we can state
        some well-known results that approximate the number of comparisons
        necessary to search for an item.

        The most important piece of information we need to analyze the use of a
        hash table is the load factor, ùúÜ. Conceptually, if ùúÜ is small, then
        there is a lower chance of collisions, meaning that items are more
        likely to be in the slots where they belong. If ùúÜ is large, meaning
        that the table is filling up, then there are more and more collisions.
        This means that collision resolution is more difficult, requiring more
        comparisons to find an empty slot. With chaining, increased collisions
        means an increased number of items on each chain.

        As before, we will have a result for both a successful and an
        unsuccessful search. For a suc- cessful search using open addressing
        with linear probing, the average number of comparisons is approximately
        1/2(1 + 1/1-ùúÜ) and an unsuccessful search gives 1/2(1+(1/1-ùúÜ)squared)
        If we are using chaining, the average number of comparisons
        is 1 + ùúÜ/2 for the successful case, and simply ùúÜ comparisons if the
        search is unsuccessful.
